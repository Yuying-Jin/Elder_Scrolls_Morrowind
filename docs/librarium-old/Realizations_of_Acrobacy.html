            <p>Realizations of Acrobacy</p>
            
            <p>by Master <span class="person" id="RhunenZebavi">Rhunen Zebavi</span></p>
            
            
            <p>Master <span class="person">Gothren</span> agreed to see the acrobats because he needed entertaining. For months now, he had
               been struggling with his fellow <span class="group" id="HouseTelvanni">Telvanni</span> Councilor, Master <span class="person">Neloth</span>. Recently he always found himself on the defensive. It was intolerable - Master <span class="person">Gothren</span> losing a battle with the contemptible <span class="person">Neloth</span>. Inspired by their master's weapon,<span class="item" id="mehrunesrazor"> Mehrunes' Razor&gt;</span>, <span class="person">Neloth</span>'s normally cowardly troops had been nigh invincible. <span class="person">Gothren</span>'s own troops had no hope, except to pray that <span class="person">Mehrunes Dagon</span> would reclaim his artifact. Considering how much havoc it was causing, it seemed
               likely that the <span class="person">daedra prince</span> would allow Master <span class="person">Neloth</span> its use for some time to come.</p>
            
            
            <p>An acrobatic distraction would be a welcome relief.</p>
            
            
            <p>"What tricks can your troupe perform?" asked the wizard to the lead acrobat, <span class="person">Rhunen Zebavi</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>"Mighty <span class="person">Gothren</span>, alas, we know no tricks. All the realizations of acrobacy we perform are real with
               no illusions. We wish we knew tricks, for it's far too time-consuming to have to master
               actual feats."</p>
            
            
            <p>"Very well, what realizations of acrobacy can you perform?" asked <span class="person">Gothren</span> with what almost looked like a smile.</p>
            
            
            <p>"Master <span class="person">Jereth</span> will dazzle you as he juggles fifteen flaming globes while hopping across broken
               glass. Master <span class="person">Tulkiande</span> will astound you as she supports her body with one finger while rotating hoops in
               ornate patterns with her legs. Master <span class="person">Mearvis</span> will take a simple ebony blade --"</p>
            
            
            <p>"And the <span class="group">outlander</span> female?" asked the Ashkhan with some disapprobation and a dismissive gesture toward
               the <span class="group">Redguard</span> woman in the troupe.</p>
            
            
            <p>"Master <span class="person">Senyndie</span>? Ah, Mighty <span class="person">Gothren</span>, she hails from the <span class="location">Alik'r Desert</span> of <span class="location">Hammerfell</span> where she won renown for her skill at climbing sheer surfaces. You must see her at
               work to believe it. She moves vertically like you and I move horizontally."</p>
            
            
            <p>"That is all very well, but I do not like <span class="group">outlander</span>s in my court," said the Ashkhan. "Many are spies."</p>
            
            
            <p>"Oh, well, Master <span class="person">Neloth</span> felt similiarly [sic] that --"</p>
            
            
            <p>"<span class="person">Neloth</span>?!" roared <span class="person">Gothren</span>. "You entertained that whoreson?!"</p>
            
            
            <p> "Two days ago, yes. I remember that he said there have been strained relations between
               you two. He also had some concerns about the <span class="group">outlander</span>s in our troupe, though it was our <span class="group">Khajiit</span> tumbler Master <span class="person">S'Rabba</span> who he was particularly suspicious of. In fact, the irony is that he thought <span class="person">S'Rabba</span> was a spy for you. Well, you know <span class="group">Khajiit</span>. Actually, maybe you don't."</p>
            
            
            <p>"They are a slave race who hold little interest to me," growled <span class="person">Gothren</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p> "You're like Master <span class="person">Neloth</span> then," said <span class="person">Rhunen Zebavi</span> quickly, fully aware of <span class="person">Gothren</span>'s growing rage, which that particular comment had only enflamed. "He wasn't used
               to <span class="group">Khajiit</span> either. Or their dark sense of humor. He took some sarcastic comments from Master
               <span class="person">S'Rabba</span> literally, and we all ended up being tortured for information about you and your
               troops. You probably haven't had the experience of being tortured for information
               you don't have, have you? I wouldn't recommend it. Eventually, we were let go on the
               understanding that we would never set foot in <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span> again. Actually, not all of us were let go. Master <span class="person">S'Rabba</span> had apparently died under torture. You have probably had experience torturing the
               slave races and know how easily they break."
               </p>
            
            <p> "No, I haven't," replied Master <span class="person">Gothren</span>. The fury was dead.</p>
            
            
            <p>"We should have probably left then, but we decided that he still owed us for the entertainment
               we provided under torture. We weren't sure how to collect, but he mentioned during
               the course of his ravings that he had a very valuable bauble. A <span class="item">razor</span> of some kind."</p>
            
            
            <p> <span class="item">"Mehrunes' Razor,"</span> he gasped. "What -- what did you do?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"Masters<span class="person"> Harakostil</span> and <span class="person">Thelegorm</span> compressed themselves low enough to squirm under the gates so they could lower the
               bridge into the main courtyard of the stronghold. Masters <span class="person">Tulkiande</span>, <span class="person">Mearvis</span>, <span class="person">Jereth</span>, and I formed a pyramid to give Master <span class="person">Senyndie</span> a boost up to the tower of <span class="location">Tel Naga</span>. She scaled it to the top --"</p>
            
            
            <p>"She scaled it?" asked <span class="person">Gothren</span>, who was familiar with the tower.</p>
            
            
            <p>"It was high, but the surface of these <span class="group">Telvanni</span> mushrooms is practically a ladder to someone of Master <span class="person">Senyndie</span>'s skills. In a few minutes' time, she was in the room with the razor in hand. In
               a few more minutes, she was back down the tower and we were running for the <span class="location">Gateway Inn</span>. Now, with all humility, I would say that no one is faster on their feet than our
               troupe, but Master <span class="person">Neloth</span>'s guards were surprisingly quick. I sent the troupe through the gate to the docks
               while I distracted the guards."</p>
            
            
            <p> "I confess, I never associated brave actions with traveling acrobats," said <span class="person">Gothren</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>"It wasn't bravery, it was economics," smiled <span class="person">Rhunen Zebavi</span>. "I considered the amount of gold and time it takes to train a good troupe, and it
               seemed smarter to try to save everyone. In any case, I lured the guards around to
               the back of the <span class="location">Gateway Inn</span>, far from the others, and when I was sure they were safe, I jumped off the wall and
               into the water."</p>
            
            
            <p> "You jumped off the wall?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I did. It's pretty tall. It was a simple matter,
               especially since I could land in the water. Still, it's only a matter of rolling and
               twisting the body like so. I'll demonstrate it if you want."</p>
            
            
            <p>"Later, if you please," said the Ashkhan. "What happened then?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"We arrived here at court," said <span class="person">Rhunen Zebavi</span> simply.</p>
            
            
            <p>"And when did Master <span class="person">Neloth</span> get<span class="item"> Mehrunes' Razor&gt;</span> back from you?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"Mighty <span class="person">Gothren</span>, that part of the story hasn't happened yet," said <span class="person">Rhunen Zebavi</span>. "Are you ready for us to perform for you now? I hadn't told you yet about our latest
               realization of acrobacy when Master <span class="person">Mearvis</span> takes a simple ebony blade and juggles it in one hand and a handful of marshmerrow
               reeds in the other. I don't want to give the whole effect away, but at the end of
               the act, you have some very fine sheets of papyrus."</p>
            
            
            <p>"It sounds delightful, Master <span class="person">Rhunen Zebavi</span>," said <span class="person">Gothren</span>. "I look forward to seeing it in a few days time, but I must leave now to meet Master
               <span class="person">Neloth</span> on the field. I will soon return for a victory celebration, and I want to see all
               your realizations of acrobacy. In the meantime, you will be honored guests with every
               luxury the Archmagister of House <span class="group">Telvanni</span> can afford."</p>
            
            
            <p>"So the room and board will be almost as nice as a third rate show in <span class="location">Rihad</span>," said <span class="person">Senyndie</span> as they took their rooms a few hours later. "Why do we bother with these backwoods
               performances?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"There are already so many jugglers in <span class="location">Rihad</span>," said <span class="person">Rhunen Zebavi</span> with a shrug.</p>
