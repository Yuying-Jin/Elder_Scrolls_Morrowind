            <p> Principle Districts of <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span></p>
            
            <p>
               <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> is the district seat of
               House Redoran, and one of the largest settlements on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>. The three principal districts are <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> town, <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>-under-Skar, and <span class="location">Buckmoth Fort</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>
               <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> town is a large settlement
               in the Redoran village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and
               undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native
               insects. Most guildhalls, cornerclubs, and merchants are sited in the southwest corner
               of town, convenient to West Gate and the strider port, while the <span class="location">Temple</span> is located on high ground to the east, and
               surrounded by a residential section.</p>
            
            
            <p>
               <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>-under-Skar is the most
               distinctive architectural feature of <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> -- a manor and council district sheltered beneath the shell of
               an ancient extinct giant crab. The large carapace encloses a central dome, from which
               radiate the entrances to the Redoran Council chambers, the manors of the Redoran
               councilors, and shops of a few upscale merchants.</p>
            
            
            <p>
               <span class="location">Buckmoth Fort</span> is the Imperial
               legion garrison for the district. The strong walls and towers of this Western fortress
               lies a short distance to the south of <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> town, through South Gate behind the Mages Guild.</p>
            
            
            <p> Services</p>
            
            <p> House Redoran services are in the Council House and Councilor's Manors of <span class="location">Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar</span>. The
               <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>
               <span class="location">Temple</span> on the east side of town
               provides service for <span class="location">Temple</span>
               worshipers. <span class="location">Buckmoth Fort</span>
               offers services to the Imperial Legion and devotees of the Imperial cult, including
               an
               Imperial cult altar. The guildhalls of the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild are near
               the
               South Gate. Pricy but high-quality clothier, alchemist, and enchanter shops are under
               Skar as well. Commodities at reasonable prices, but with smaller selections, are
               available from the smith, clothier, trader, pawnbroker, and bookseller near the entrance
               to <span class="location">Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar</span>.
               The <span class="location">Ald Skar Inn</span> and the
               <span class="location">Council Club
                  cornerclub</span> are found to the west, near West Gate and the silt strider
               port. <span class="location">The Rat in the Pot</span>
               cornerclub is in south <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>,
               near the guildhalls.</p>
            
            
            <p> Notable figures</p>
            
            <p> All six Redoran councilors, <span class="person" id="BraraMorvayn">Brara Morvayn</span>, <span class="person">Hlaren Ramoran</span>, <span class="person">Athyn
                  Sarethi</span>, <span class="person">Garisa Llethri</span>, <span class="person">Miner Arobar</span>, and <span class="person">Bolvyn
                  Venim</span>, have manor residences in <span class="location">Ald'ruhn-Under_skar</span>. <span class="person">Edwinna
                  Elbert</span> is the Mages Guild steward, and <span class="person">Percius Mercius</span> has recently become the Fighters Guild steward. Old
               <span class="person">Methal Seran</span> is an eminent <span class="location">Temple</span> priest and scholar. <span class="person">Raesa Pullia</span> is commandant of <span class="location">Buckmoth Fort</span>, but <span class="person">Imsin the Dreamer</span> is the chapter steward. The
               Redguard <span class="person">Hean</span> is priest of the Imperial cult. <span class="person">Goren Andarys</span> is the guild steward of the <span class="person">Morag Tong</span>, whose guildhall is found in <span class="location">Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p> Travel and Transportation</p>
            
            <p> Roads lead northwest to <span class="location">Maar Gan</span> and
               <span class="location">Gnisis</span> villages and by a
               circuitous western route to <span class="location">Caldera</span>,
               <span class="location">Balmora</span>, and points south. The
               road to <span class="location">Balmora</span> swings northwest to
               avoid the barren wastes, and curves around towards the west until it heads south again
               to <span class="location">Caldera</span>. Between <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> and <span class="location">Caldera</span> are many sidepaths; watch for signposts, or
               you'll get lost. The silt strider port is along the western town wall, north of West
               Gate. Silt strider service goes from <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> to <span class="location">Balmora</span>,
               <span class="location">Gnisis</span>, <span class="location">Khuul</span>, or <span class="location">Maar
                  Gan</span>.. Guild guides at the Mages Guild teleport you to <span class="location">Balmora</span>, <span class="location">Vivec City</span>, <span class="location">Caldera</span>, and <span class="location">Sadrith
                  Mora</span> for a modest fee. Gnaar Mok is a LONG and exceptionally unpleasant
               walk west to the coast and then south; there are no trails or marked routes. Casual
               travelers ill-equipped for the attacks of wild beasts and brigands should keep to
               the
               roads and travel services.</p>
