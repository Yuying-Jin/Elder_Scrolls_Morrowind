            <h1>Honor Among Thieves</h1>
            <h3>Arnie the Scrib</h3>
            <h4>Acquisitions</h4>
            <ul id="acq">
               <li>Ald'ruhn: Visitable? </li>
               <li>The Rat in the Pot: Visitable? </li>
               <li>Balmora: Visitable? </li>
               <li>South Wall Cornerclub: Visitable? </li>
               <li>Vivec: Visitable? </li>
               <li>Simine Fralinie: Bookseller: Visitable? </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Many admirers ask, "<span class="person" id="&gt;ArnietheScrib">Arnie</span>, how can I become a flash and prosperous fellow like you?"</p>
            
            
            <p>And I tell them, "You want to join <span class="group" id="ThievesGuild">the Guild</span>. Make friends. Be a part of something."</p>
            
            
            <p>"But who can join?" they ask.</p>
            
            
            <p> We're just like any other trade guild. We've got requirements. And if you want to
               advance in the ranks, we've got standards.</p>
            
            
            <p>You want to be fast and agile. You want to move undetected. You want to know about
               security -- locks, traps, and how to get around them. You want to defend yourself.
               You travel light and fast, and want light arms like <span class="item" id="dagger">daggers</span> and <span class="item">shortswords</span>. You don't want to get into a slugging match, so you want the marksman's weapons
               -- the <span class="item">bow</span>, <span class="item">crossbow</span>, <span class="item">throwing star</span>, and <span class="item">dart</span>. You want <span class="item">light armor</span>, so you can keep moving, and moving fast.</p>
            
            
            <p>Why belong? Simple. Everybody needs <span class="group">friends</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>The help of <span class="group">friends</span> includes information. Your friends at the <span class="group">Thieves Guild</span> know where the action is, and where the action is safe, and where it is not. The
               help of <span class="group">friends</span> includes a place to rest, and a place to buy supplies and services -- training and
               tools. The help of friends includes fixing things with the guards at a discount rate.
               That's where the 'honor among thieves' part comes in. Friends stick together, and
               help each other.</p>
            
            
            <p>"But what about the competition?" my admirers ask.</p>
            
            
            <p>The competition is the <span class="group">Camonna Tong</span>. And you don't want to join them, because they don't want you and they're not very
               nice. They have this thing about <span class="group">outlanders</span>. They want them all dead. So, unless your ambition is to be dead, you don't want
               to join them.</p>
            
            
            <p>And the <span class="group">Camonna Tong</span> are bad people. The <span class="group">Camonna Tong</span> don't mind killing people. Heck, they LIKE killing people. The <span class="group">Thieves Guild</span>, on the other hand, thinks killing people is bad business. You want to be good people,
               right? So join the <span class="group">Thieves Guild</span>, and stay far, far away from the <span class="group">Camonna Tong</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>So you want to join. But where do you look?</p>
            
            
            <p>Being a thief is not like being a fighter. You don't just go to the local guild Hall.
               The <span class="group">Thieves Guild</span> doesn't have Guild Halls. But thieves like to be where their <span class="group">friends</span> are. And where are their <span class="group">friends</span>? At the local <span class="location">cornerclub</span> or trade house. In <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>, look for friends in <span class="location">Balmora</span>, <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>, <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>, and the <span class="location">Foreign Quarter of Vivec</span>.
