            <p>"The Test of Pattern requires the observer to examine and analyze for patterns before
               he
               acts, with the understanding that many patterns are subtle or hidden.</p>
            
            
            <p>"The Test of Disorder requires the observer to proceed systematically when no pattern
               is perceived. When
               the observer recognizes that many things must be done, and in no specific order; the
               procedure is to perceive and order all the things to be done, and, upon doing a thing,
               to
               recall how and when that thing has been done. For example, the observer must remember
               the
               initial position of a thing, and also the new position of that thing.</p> 
            
            
            <p>"The Test of Evasion requires the observer to examine the obstacle, and compare his
               resources and abilities; if
               the obstacle is too difficult, seek for a path around the difficulty.</p> 
            
            
            <p>"The Test ofConfrontation requires the observer to examine the obstacle, and compare
               his resources and
               abilities; if the obstacle is too difficult, look for a path around the difficulty...
               but if
               no path around can be found, confront the obstacle directly."</p>
