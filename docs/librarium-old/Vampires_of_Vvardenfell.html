            <p>...The violent antipathy of <span class="location">Morrowind </span>culture toward necromancy ensures that <span class="group" id="vampire">vampire</span>s are virtually unknown in <span class="location">Morrowind</span>...</p>
            
            <p>...The <span class="group">Temple</span> does not acknowledge the existence of Western <span class="group">vampire</span> hunting orders. Nonetheless, interviews with <span class="group">Temple</span> officials persuade me that the <span class="group">Dunmer</span> of <span class="location">Morrowind</span> are experienced and knowledgeable in the handling of these menaces. On the other
               hand, they freely admit that even a large community of <span class="group">vampire</span>s might easily escape detection in the remote wastelands, or in the subterranean labyrinths
               of abandoned strongholds and wizard towers....</p>
            
            <p>...The "ash <span class="group">vampire</span>" of <span class="group">Ashlander</span>legend is not undead. Sorceries and blessings affecting the undead reportedly have
               no effect on these creatures. No specimen has ever been examined, and no references
               have ever linked these legends with the known clans of <span class="group">Tamrielic</span> <span class="group">vampire</span>s....</p>
            
            <p>...<span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>'s three known bloodlines differ greatly in their approach to prey. The <span class="group">Quarra</span> bloodline features exceptional strength and endurance, and attacks in a state of
               ecstatic frenzy. <span class="group">Aundae</span> <span class="group">vampire</span>s are potent spellcasters, seeking to hypnotize victims before feeding, while the
               swift and agile <span class="group">Berne</span> clan <span class="group">vampire</span>s prefer stealth and ambush, first poisoning the victim with a bite, then withdrawing
               to a safe distance, returning to feed only when the prey has weakened...</p>
            
            <p>...It is supposed that vampirism is contracted from wounds received from a <span class="group">vampire</span>. Since few victims survive vampiric attacks or feedings, the process of contracting
               the disease is little understood. Some have suggested that victims may willingly submit
               themselves to the will of a <span class="group">vampire</span>, but no real evidence of this exists....</p>
            
            <p>...During the incubation phase, lasting up to 72 hours, the vampirism disease exhibits
               no symptoms, and may be cured by general spellcraft or cult blessings. However, during
               incubation, some victims have reported sleep disturbances and troubling dreams. After
               symptoms are exhibited, however, the disease is incurable and irreversible....</p>
            
            <p>... In the West, a shadowy fraternity of <span class="group">vampire</span> hunters is believed to be primarily composed of formerly afflicted <span class="group">vampire</span>s who have been cured of the disease. According to legend, the <span class="group">vampire</span> Hunters refuse to reveal the cure to the disease for fear that it may encourage depraved
               thrill seekers from deliberately infecting themselves.</p>
            
            <p>In the East, the Western tradition of <span class="group">vampire</span> Hunters is unknown. Vampirism is known to be incurable, and even if it were curable,
               a cured <span class="group">vampire</span> would be an abomination to be destroyed. Since the disease is infallibly cured if
               treated within three days, failure to treat oneself after an encounter with a <span class="group">vampire</span> would be considered a deliberate attempt to contract the disease, and a mark of monstrous
               depravity....</p>
            
            <p>... In <span class="group">Temple</span> doctrine, one ancient tradition holds that, among his many other crimes, Molag Bal,
               the Father of Monsters, spawned the first <span class="group">vampire</span> upon the corpse of a defeated foe. Several different versions of this story exist,
               with the foe variously identified as a Daedra Lord, a <span class="group">Temple</span> Saint, or a powerful beast creature. This account of the origin of vampirism is peculiar
               to <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, appearing nowhere else in <span class="group">Imperial</span> lore. Unfortunately, scholarly inquiry upon this topic is discouraged by the <span class="group">Temple</span>, which controls access to the only substantial collection of historical and cultural
               records in <span class="location">Morrowind</span>....</p>
            
            <p>... Though the <span class="group">Dunmer</span> believe the disease is incurable, a <span class="group">Buoyant Armiger</span> of former years named <span class="person" id="GalurRithari">Galur Rithari</span> insisted that he was cured of vampirism. Initially imprisoned by the <span class="group">Temple</span> for heresy, he later recanted, was released, and served his final years as a librarian
               in the Hall of Wisdom in <span class="location">Vivec</span>. It is interesting that previous to his imprisonment for heresy, Rithari had been
               posted to the <span class="group">Buoyant Armiger</span> garrison at <span class="location">Bal Ur</span>, a pilgrimage site known as the "birthplace of Molag Bal."</p>
