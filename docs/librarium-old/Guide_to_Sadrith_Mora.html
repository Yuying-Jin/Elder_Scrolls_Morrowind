               <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span> is the district
               seat of House Telvanni, and home of the Telvanni Council, though only one Telvanni
               councilor actually lives in <span class="location">Sadrith
                  Mora</span>. <span class="location">Sadrith
                  Mora</span> is an island settlement, and accessible only by sea and
               teleportation. The town is large, with many craftsmen, traders, and trainers, but
               it is
               open only to Telvanni retainers; outsiders should confine themselves to the <span class="location">Gateway Inn</span>, and to <span class="location">Wolverine Hall</span>, the Imperial
               quarters of the <span class="group" id="Legion">Legion</span> garrison and guilds. The docks are in
               a sheltered bay on the western side of the island, and a trail leads up from the docks
               to the <span class="location">Gateway Inn</span>. Beyond the
               <span class="location">Gateway Inn</span> is the Great
               Market, with numerous craftsmen and traders, and a small slave market. North of the
               Great Market is the <span class="location">Telvanni
                  Council Hall</span>, a large orb supported by giant mushroom stalks. To the east
               of the Great Market is <span class="location">Tel Naga</span>, the
               towering wizard-tower residence of Telvanni Councilor Mage-Lord <span class="person">Master Neloth</span>.</p>

               Telvanni services are available in the Great Market district and in <span class="location">Tel Naga</span>. The Gateway merchant inn is the
               only establishment with public beds. Members of the <span class="group">Fighters
                  Guild</span>, <span class="group">Mages Guild</span>, and <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>s look for hospitality at <span class="location">Wolverine Hall</span>. Telvanni kin and
               retainers stay at the Gateway, at <span class="location">Wolverine Hall</span>, at a local cornerclub, or at <span class="location">Tel Naga</span>. The Great Market has many services and
               tradesmen, and many others are scattered through town. There are two cornerclubs:
               <span class="location">Dirty Muriel's</span>, for
               outlanders, and <span class="location">Fara's Hole in
                  the Wall</span> for local <span class="group">Dunmer</span>. <span class="location">Tel Naga</span> is <span class="person">Master Neloth</span>'s wizard tower.</p>
