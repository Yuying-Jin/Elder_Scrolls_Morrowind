            <p>I have been asked to write this guidebook for outsiders who are unfamiliar with the
               <span class="location">Tribunal Temple</span>, and
               interested in joining.</p>
            
            
            <p>All those who are earnest, and who are willing to submit to the wisdom of Blessed
               <span class="person" id="Almsivi">Almsivi</span>, Triune Grace, the saints, and the priests, are
               welcome to the Fellowship of the <span class="location">Tribunal Temple</span>. The Temple is the religion of <span class="location">Morrowind</span> and Dunmer people, and has been for generation
               upon generation. With guidance and counsel of Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil, the
               Anticipations, and all the hosts of saints of ancestors, the Temple guards and protects
               the lands and peoples of <span class="location">Morrowind</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>Those who follow the Tribunal must have the Personality to lead others and the Willpower
               to resist the world's temptations. When violence is needful, we fight with staves
               and
               hammers, armored only in our faith. We study Restoration and Alchemy to heal the people,
               and Mysticism to learn more of the divine. We must also study Conjuration to speak
               with
               the spirits of our ancestors and protect against those who traffic with the Four
               Corners.</p>
            
            
            <p>Those interested in joining the <span class="location">Tribunal
                  Temple</span> should speak to priests at the temples in <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>, <span class="location">Balmora</span>, <span class="location">Molag</span>
               Mar, and Ghostgate, or with priests at the High Fane in the Temple Compound in Vivec
               City.</p>
            
            
            <p>Articles of Faith</p>
            
            <p>The Temple believes that Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil were mortal guardians of
               <span class="location">Morrowind</span> who walked the earth,
               defeated the Dunmer's greatest enemies, the <span class="group" id="Nords">Nords</span> and the
               <span class="group">Dwarves</span>, and achieved divine substance through
               superhuman discipline and virtue and supernatural wisdom and insight. Like loving
               ancestors, they guard and counsel their followers. Like stern parents, they punish
               sin
               and error. Like generous relatives, they share their bounty among the greatest and
               least, according to their needs.</p>
            
            
            <p>Duties of the Faithful</p>
            
            <p>Your fourfold duties are to: Faith, Family, Masters, and all that is good. Perform
               holy
               quests and bring luster to the Temple. Never transgress against your brothers or
               sisters, and never dishonor your house or your ancestors. Serve and protect the poor
               and
               weak, and honor your elders and clan.</p>
            
            
            <p>For those who would be wise, these sacred books will be of interest.</p>
            
            
            <p>Saryoni's Sermons Learn from the teachings of Vivec, and from the Archcanon's sermons
               on
               the Seven Graces.</p>
            
            
            <p>Lives of the Saints Members of the Temple who wish to be virtuous will model their
               lives
               on the lives of the saints.</p>
            
            
            <p>The Pilgrim's Path The path to wisdom and self-knowledge is through pilgrimage. Those
               who
               would rise in the ranks of the faithful may retrace the steps of the Lords and Saints,
               and gain blessings and learn virtue by suffering and overcoming hardships.</p>
            
            
            <p>The Consolations of Prayer Learn what bounties and blessing might be gained by prayer
               at
               the shrines found in temples, and in places of pilgrimage, and in the tombs of our
               ancestors.</p>
