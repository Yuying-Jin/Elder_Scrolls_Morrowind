            <ul id="acq">
               <li>Vivec City, Hlaalu
                  Treasury: Visitable? yes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> Vivec is the largest settlement on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>, and one of the largest cities in the East. Each of the
               great cantons is the size of a complete town. The <span class="location">High Fane</span> and the <span class="location">palace of Vivec</span> are visited by hundreds of tourists and
               pilgrims daily. Citizens flock to the Arena for public entertainments like mock battles
               and comic plays. Outlanders mostly confine themselves to the <span class="location">Foreign Canton</span>, while natives live,
               work, and shop in the Great House compounds and residential cantons. But most of all,
               this is Lord Vivec's holy city. The <span class="location">Ministry of Truth</span>, the Temple prison, hangs above the great temple of
               the <span class="location">High Fane</span>, the Halls of Wisdom
               and Justice, and Lord Vivec's Palace.</p>
            
            
            <p> Vivec is a city made up of eight cantons, each a little town in itself. On a map,
               it
               looks like a cross, with the Foreign Quarter at the top, the Temple Compound, with
               Vivec's Palace, the <span class="location">High Fane</span>, the
               <span class="location">Ministry of Truth</span>, and
               the <span class="location">Hall of Wisdom</span> and the
               <span class="location">Hall of Justice</span> at the
               bottom, the Hlaalu Compound to the west, the Telvanni Compound on the east, and four
               cantons grouped together at the center of the cross -- Redoran Compound northwest,
               Arena
               northeast, St. Delyn's Canton southwest, and St. Olms Canton southeast.</p>
            
            
            <p> The Foreign Quarter</p>
            
            <p> The Foreign Quarter is the large three-tiered canton to the north. Originally,
               foreigners were not allowed to enter Vivec any further than the Foreign Quarter, but
               now
               outlanders can travel throughout Vivec at will. The Imperial Guilds each have guildhalls
               and complete services here, and an Imperial cult shrine serves the spiritual needs
               of
               the Imperial faithful. Various independent tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers also
               rent
               space here. The <span class="location">Black Shalk
                  Cornerclub</span> rents beds to non-guild visitors.</p>
            
            
            <p> Temple Compound</p>
            
            <p> The <span class="location">High Fane</span> is the largest
               Tribunal temple on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>.
               <span class="person">Archcanon Saryoni</span> presides over the temple,
               along with a large staff of priests, healers, and monks. Pilgrims travel from all
               over
               Morrowind to view the <span class="location">High Fane</span> and
               the <span class="location">Ministry of Truth</span>, and
               to offer prayer and thanks before the <span class="location">Palace of Vivec</span>. The <span class="location">Ministry of Truth</span>, a celestial body suspended by <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s mighty power over the Temple Compound, is the headquarters of the
               Temple Ordinators, and heretics are imprisoned and re-educated there. The <span class="location">Hall of Wisdom</span> and <span class="location">Hall of Justice</span> contain the
               executive, administrative, judicial, and martial operations of the Tribunal Temple.
               The
               <span class="location">Palace of Vivec</span> is the
               abode of the god-hero Lord Vivec, the Warrior-Poet of the three deities who comprise
               <span class="group" id="Almsivi">Almsivi</span>, the divine patrons of the Tribunal Temple.
               Only the most devout are admitted to the presence of Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span>, and only at his initiation. Beneath the <span class="location">Palace of Vivec</span> is the <span class="location">Puzzle Canal</span>, a place of worship and
               testing for questing heroes hoping to receive <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s
               favor. Many choice treasures are guarded by Daedric servants in the <span class="location">Puzzle Canal</span>'s dark passages.</p>
            
            
            <p> Hlaalu Compound</p>
            
            <p> Hlaalu Compound is the westmost canton. The Hlaalu Councilor <span class="person">Crassius Curio</span> has a splendid tier-top mansion here.
               The tiers below contain Hlaalu treasuries, records, holding cells, and various Great
               House services. There are two public houses: the <span class="group">Elven
                  Nations</span> and the <span class="group">No Name Club</span>. A variety of
               craftsmen and tradesmen also have shops at Hlaalu Compound. Some House Hlaalu nobles
               and
               retainers prefer to maintain their residences in the less-formal St. Delyn and St.
               Olms
               cantons.</p>
            
            
            <p> Telvanni Compound</p>
            
            <p> Telvanni Compound is the eastmost canton. The mage-lord <span class="person">Mavon
                  Drenim</span> is the ranking Telvanni noble. The Telvanni rent the compound from
               the Temple, and have to make do with a Velothi tower instead of their preferred mushroom
               towers. The administrative center includes a treasury and a hall of records. Slaves
               are
               housed in the lowest tiers, along with cells full of monsters. There are many tradesmen,
               craftsmen, and trainers, and <span class="location">the
                  Lizard's Head</span> cornerclub provides lodgings for Telvanni kin and
               mercenaries.</p>
            
            
            <p> Redoran Compound</p>
            
            <p> Redoran Compound is the canton south of the Foreign Quarter, west of and next to
               the
               Arena. The Redoran administrative center there includes the <span class="location">Redoran Treasury</span>, <span class="location">Hall of Records</span>, and <span class="location">Holding Cells</span>. On the lowest tier is
               a Redoran shrine and ancestral vaults. Two noble families, the Savens and the Dralors,
               have top-tier manors. There are many tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers, and the
               <span class="location">Flowers of Gold</span>
               cornerclub provides lodgings for Redoran kin and retainers.</p>
            
            
            <p> Arena Compound</p>
            
            <p> The Arena Compound lies between the Redoran compound on the west and the Telvanni
               compound on the east. The Arena is the site of public entertainments and combat sports.
               The comfortable domed Arena has seating for hundreds of spectators; beneath the Arena
               are dressing and storage rooms for entertainers and training rooms and animal pens
               for
               the combat competitors.</p>
            
            
            <p> St. Delyn and St. Olms Residential Cantons</p>
            
            <p> St. Delyn Canton and St. Olms Canton are residence cantons for commoners and paupers.
               The Temple charges very reasonable rents for comfortable workshops, shops, and
               apartments, and most of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>'s crafts and light industry are housed in these cantons.
               <span class="location">The Abbey of St.
                  Delyn the Wise</span> is on the top tier of St. Delyn, and Hlaalu Councilor
               <span class="person">Yngling Half-Troll</span> has a top-tier manor on
               St. Olms.</p>
            
            
            <p> Transportation</p>
            
            <p> Foot bridges connect with the mainland between the <span class="location">Ebonheart</span> region and Hlaalu Compound, between the north
               bay region and the Foreign Quarter, and between the east bay region and Telvanni
               Compound. Good roads lead from the Hlaalu Compound bridge south to <span class="location">Ebonheart</span> and north to <span class="location">Seyda Neen</span> and points north. Good roads
               lead from the Foreign Quarter bridge west towards <span class="location">Seyda Neen</span>, north towards <span class="location">Suran</span> and the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>, and east towards <span class="location">Molag Mar</span>. Roads from the Telvanni
               Compound bridge are useful mostly for travelers to <span class="location">Molag Mar</span>. Silt strider service is available at the north
               end of the Foreign Quarter bridge, traveling from Vivec to <span class="location">Suran</span>, <span class="location">Seyda
                  Neen</span>, <span class="location">Balmora</span>, and
               <span class="location">Molag Mar</span>. Ships from the docks
               at the Foreign Quarter travel to <span class="location">Ebonheart</span>, <span class="location">Hla Oad</span>,
               <span class="location">Molag Mar</span>, and <span class="location">Tel Branora</span>. Ships from nearby
               <span class="location">Ebonheart</span> sail to <span class="location">Hla Oad</span>, Sadrith Mora, <span class="location">Tel Branora</span>, and the Foreign Quarter of
               <span class="person">Vivec</span>. Low-fare gondolas shuttle passengers from canton
               to canton via Vivec's canals.</p>
