            <p>I am a councilor of House <span class="group" id="Hlaalu">Hlaalu</span> and chose to write this short guide for those who seek
               to understand us or join us. House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> is the most open and modern of the Great
               Houses. We are the only Great House who has embraced the irresistible tides of Imperial
               law and custom. And thus we have profited by the <span class="group">Empire</span>'s new policies, rising from
               obscurity as the Greatest of the Houses.</p>
            
            
            <p>In the great wind of progress, tradition cannot stand.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <span class="group">Redoran</span> may surpass us on the field of battle, but when the dust clears, they will
               find themselves indebted to us. The House <span class="group">Telvanni</span> may know many arcane secrets, but
               they fight among themselves more than against each other, and they cannot adapt to
               the
               ways of the <span class="group">Empire</span>. Ancient and powerful though a <span class="group">Telvanni</span> wizard may be, no individual
               can withstand the march of history. The <span class="group">Indoril</span> are loved by the people for their gifts
               and donations, but when the money runs dry, will the people remember? The <span class="group">Dres</span> know how
               to make money, but they have not learned how not to make enemies.</p>
            
            
            <p>Grasp fortune by the forelocks. When you see your chances, seize them.</p>
            
            
            <p>When you see a chance to turn a profit, take it. But do not follow money blindly.
               There
               is value in reputation, more than many young <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> realize. This value must be
               carefully balanced against the more tangible coins in any deal. Theft and murder are
               bad
               for business. You can steal from someone, but will he trade with you after that? You
               can't bargain with a dead man.</p>
            
            
            <p>There are many ways to do business.</p>
            
            
            <p>In House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> you must be fast and agile. You must be able to keep up with business and
               with the times. You must be able to speak quickly and convincingly. You must be able
               to
               trade with the best of merchants and make a profit. You must learn to protect your
               own
               property by securing it with hidden chests, locks, and even traps. And when
               confrontation is unavoidable, it is best to fight quickly in comfortable, light armors
               with short blades, or to fight from a distance with a marksman's weapons.</p>
            
            
            <p>Then, reader, would you seize this opportunity to join House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span>? Would you have
               yourself be counted among the victors in the race for success? Then submit yourself
               for
               examination at the Balmora Council Manor. If you have the skills, you will be welcome.
               And if you have the will, you may serve House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span>, and advance in the ranks, for
               above all things, House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> prizes initiative and ambition. </p>
