            Councilor Representatives of House Telvanni, Council Hall, Sadrith Mora
            
            For Archmagister Gothren: Mouth Mallam Ryon, Mage
            For Master Aryon: Mouth Arara Uvulas
            For Master Neloth: Mouth Raven Omayn

            For Mistress Dratha: Mouth Mallam Ryon
            Council Actions
            
            In response to repeated protests from Duke Dren and representative of the other Great
            Houses, Telvanni Council reminded them that, according to ancient law and custom,
            Telvanni Council places no constraint on the ambitions and enterprise of its individual
            members. If the Empire or other House Councils wish to dispute Telvanni exploration
            and colonization of the wastes and wildernesses of Vvardenfell, they are welcome to
            do so, with the Councilors' best wishes, but Telvanni Council will not contribute
            its resources or authority to such endeavors.
            
            The council renews its objection to proposals placed before Duke Dren and the Grand
            Council concerning slavery and slave trading in Vvardenfell District. The right to
            own and trade slaves is guaranteed by the terms of the Treaty of the Armistice, and
            Telvanni Council will not entertain any discussion of abridgements of those rights.
