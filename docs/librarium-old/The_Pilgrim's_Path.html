            <h4>Acquisitions</h4>
            <ul id="acq">
               <li>Fields of Kummu: Visitable? yes</li>
               <li>Ghostgate: Visitable? yes</li>
               <li>Gnisis: Visitable? yes</li>

               <li>Vivec: Visitable? yes</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <p>The pilgrim must visit each of the <span class="location">Shrines of the Seven Graces</span>. At each site the pilgrim must stand before the three-sided stone triolith and read
               the inscription. To ease the pilgrim's task, the <span class="group" id="Temple">Temple </span> has made this list of shrines along with directions and advice to pilgrims. The blessings
               of each shrine last at least a half day.</p>
            
            <p>The <span class="location">Fields of Kummu</span>: Shrine of Humility</p>
            
            <p>Here Lord <span class="person" id="Vivec">Vivec</span> met a poor farmer whose <span class="item" id="guar">guar</span> had died. The farmer could not harvest his <span class="item">muck</span> without his <span class="item">guar</span>, and he could not provide for his family or his village. So the Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> removed his fine clothes and toiled in the fields like a beast of burden until the
               crop was harvested. It is at the <span class="location">Fields of Kummu</span> we go to pray for the same humility Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> showed on that day.</p>
            
            <p>The <span class="location">Fields of Kummu</span> are west of <span class="location">Suran</span> on the north shore of <span class="location">Lake Amaya</span> as you head towards <span class="location">Pelagiad</span>. The shrine is between two rocks, and most easily noticed while traveling east along
               the road. <span class="person">Alof</span>'s farm nearby has a small dock on the north bank of <span class="location">Lake Amaya</span>. This is the only dock nearby which <span class="person">Alof</span> kindly allows servants of the <span class="group">Temple </span> to use. It is customary to leave a portion of <span class="item">muck</span> at the shrine to represent <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s humility.</p>
            
            <p>To Stop the Moon: The Shrine of Daring</p>
            
            <p>When Sheogorath rebelled against the Tribunal, he tricked the moon Baar Dau into forsaking
               its appointed path through <span class="location">Oblivion</span>. The Mad Star inspired the moon to hurl itself upon <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s new city, which Sheogorath claimed was built in mockery of the heavens. When <span class="person">Vivec</span> learned of Sheogorath's scheme, he froze the rogue moon in the sky with a single
               gesture and the grace of his countenance. Overwhelmed by the courage and daring of
               <span class="person">Vivec</span>, the moon Baar Dau swore itself to eternal service of the Tribunal and all its works.
               Thus the moon now stands guard over the palace, and serves as a citadel for the <span class="group">Temple </span>'s Ordinators.</p>
            
            <p>The Shrine of Daring is found in the city of <span class="person">Vivec</span>, in the <span class="location">Temple District</span>, along the western wall of the <span class="location">High Fane</span>, the great Temple of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave behind a Potion of Rising
               Force. Suitable potions may be purchased from the <span class="group">Temple </span>. Homemade potions are not acceptable.</p>
            
            <p>The Palace: Shrine of Generosity</p>
            
            <p>Long after Lord <span class="person">Nerevar</span> and the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> triumphed over <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span>, the people wished to build a monument to the heroes of that war. Vivec thanked them,
               but said that it would be better to dedicate a monument not only to the glorious heroes,
               but to all people, great and small, who suffered and died in the war. It became the
               custom to make offerings here, either in thanks of our good fortune, or for those
               less fortunate.</p>
            
            <p>The Shrine of Generosity is on the top steps of Vivec's Palace, the southernmost Canton
               of Vivec City. The customary donation for those in good fortune is 100 gold.</p>
            
            <p>In a battle with <span class="person">Mehrunes Dagon</span>, <span class="person">Vivec</span> gave his own silver longsword to the <span class="group">Daedra</span> Lord rather than dishonor himself by fighting an unarmed foe. This so impressed the
               <span class="group">Dremora</span>, the most honorable and chivalrous of <span class="person">Mehrunes Dagon</span>'s Daedric servants, that they now share a bond of respect and courtesy with the followers
               of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>, though we must never forget that they are our enemies.</p>
            
            <p>The Shrine of Courtesy is found in the heart of the <span class="location">Puzzle Canal</span>, a labyrinth beneath Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s Palace in the city of <span class="person">Vivec</span>. The journey though the <span class="location">Puzzle Canal</span> can be confusing and it is suggested that common pilgrims carry a scroll of ALMSIVI
               Intervention in case they get lost. The <span class="group">Dremora</span> <span class="person">Krazzt</span> is found in the center of the <span class="location">Puzzle Canal</span>, and will accept a plain silver longsword if spoken to with courtesy. After <span class="person">Krazzt</span> accepts the sword, pilgrims must read the inscription on the triolith.</p>
            
            <p>The Mask of <span class="person">Vivec</span>: Shrine of Justice</p>
            
            <p>Near the altar is <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s Ash Mask. In the Days of Fire when <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span> first crept back into <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> and awakened it, <span class="person">Vivec</span> led refugees here as they fled the ash and blight. Weary, they rested here a while.
               When <span class="person">Vivec</span> awoke, he found himself and all his followers encased in casts of grey ash. Frozen
               like a sleeping statue and unable to free himself or help his people, <span class="person">Vivec</span> was filled with despair. <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s tears weakened his ash cast. He tore the ash from his perished followers, breathed
               life into their lungs, and cured them of the blight. This is <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s heroism -- his tender heart provides strength when his might fails.</p>
            
            <p>The Shrine of Justice is guarded within the <span class="location">Gnisis</span> Temple, in the village of <span class="location">Gnisis</span>, northwest by road from the town of <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a potion of <span class="item">Cure Common Disease</span> as a token of your respect for justice. Suitable potions may be purchased from Temple.
               Homemade potions are not acceptable.</p>
            
            <p><span class="location">Koal Cave</span>: The Shrine of Valor</p>
            
            <p>Within the <span class="location">Koal Cave</span>, <span class="person">Vivec</span> fought a battle with <span class="person">Ruddy Man</span>, the father of the <span class="group">Dreugh</span>. When he defeated <span class="person">Ruddy Man</span>, <span class="person">Vivec</span> spared his life, on the condition that <span class="person">Ruddy Man</span> and his children would give up their tough hides to serve as armor for the Dunmer.</p>
            
            <p>The Shrine of Valor is inside the <span class="location">Koal Cave</span>, a cavern on the seacoast west of the ancient stronghold <span class="location">Berandas</span> and south of <span class="location">Gnisis</span>. The cave mouth faces south, towards the sea, and is marked by a large natural arch
               of stone. The region is wilderness, and finding the cave mouth can be difficult. <span class="group">Dreugh</span> within the cave itself are fearsome enemies; only experienced and capable adventurers
               should attempt to re-enact the epic battle with the <span class="group">Dreugh</span> in the cave. <span class="group">Dreugh</span> wax may be bought at the Temple in <span class="location">Gnisis</span>. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a portion of <span class="item">dreugh wax</span> as a token of <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s victorious struggle with <span class="person">Ruddy Man</span>.</p>
            
            <p>The <span class="location">Ghostfence</span>: The Shrine of Pride</p>
            
            <p>The <span class="location">Ghostfence</span> is a lasting symbol of the indomitable will and power of ALMSIVI, and a monument
               to Dunmer pride in overcoming its enemies.</p>
            
            <p>The Shrine of Pride is found within the <span class="location">Ghostfence</span>, just northeast of the <span class="location">Ghostgate</span> itself. The safest route to <span class="location">Ghostgate</span> is along the <span class="location">Foyada Mamaea</span>, a volcanic ravine running from the top of <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> southwest to its end just below <span class="location">Balmora</span>. An old <span class="group">Dwemer</span> bridge crosses the foyada near <span class="location">Fort Moonmoth</span>. A pilgrim may follow the <span class="location">Foyada Mamaea</span> all the way to <span class="location">Ghostgate</span>. Any journey inside the <span class="location">Ghostfence</span> is dangerous, but even the most timid pilgrim should be safe, so long as he does
               not stray too far from the <span class="location">Ghostgate</span> and flees from any minions of <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span>. When you address the shrine, it is customary to leave a <span class="item">soul gem</span> in remembrance of our ancestors who were bound to the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>'s service.</p>
