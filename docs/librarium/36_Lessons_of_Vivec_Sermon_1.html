            <p>He was born in the ash among the <span class="group" id="Velothi">Velothi</span>, anon <span class="group">Chimer</span>, before the war with the northern
               men. <span class="person">Ayem</span> came first to the village of the netchimen, and her shadow was that of
               Boethiah, who was the Prince of Plots, and things unknown and known would fold
               themselves around her until they were like stars or the messages of stars. <span class="person">Ayem</span> took a
               netchiman's wife and said:</p>
            
            
            <p>'I am the Face-Snaked Queen of the Three in One. In you is an image and a seven-syllable
               spell, AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK, which you will repeat to it until mystery comes.'</p>
            
            
            <p>Then <span class="person">Ayem</span> threw the netchiman's wife into the ocean water where <span class="group">dreughs</span> took her into
               castles of glass and coral. They gifted the netchiman's wife with gills and milk
               fingers, changing her sex so that she might give birth to the image as an egg. There
               she
               stayed for seven or eight months.</p>
            
            
            <p>Then <span class="person">Seht</span> came to the netchiman's wife and said:</p>
            
            
            <p>'I am the Clockwork King of the Three in One. In you is an egg of my brother-sister,
               who
               possesses invisible knowledge of words and swords, which you shall nurture until the
               <span class="person">Hortator</span> comes.'</p>
            
            
            <p>And <span class="person">Seht</span> then extended his hands and multitudes of homunculi came forth, each like a
               glimmering rope through the water, and they raised the netchiman's wife back to the
               surface world and set her down on the shoals of <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>. There she lay for seven
               or eight more months, caring for the egg-knowledge by whispering to it the Codes of
               <span class="person">Mephala</span> and the prophecies of Veloth and even the forbidden teachings of <span class="person">Trinimac</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>Seven <span class="group">Daedra</span> came to her one night and each one gave to the egg new motions that could be
               achieved by certain movements of the bones. These are called the Barons of Move Like
               This. Then an eighth Daedroth came, and he was a <span class="group">Demiprince</span>, called <span class="person">Fa-Nuit-Hen</span>, or the
               Multiplier of Motions Known. And <span class="person">Fa-Nuit-Hen</span> said:</p>
            
            
            <p>'Whom do you wait for?'</p>
            
            
            <p>To which the netchiman's wife said to the <span class="person">Hortator</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>'Go to the land of the <span class="group">Indoril</span> in three months' time, for that is when war comes. I
               return now to haunt the warriors who fell and still wonder why. But first I show you
               this.'</p>
            
            
            <p>Then the Barons and the <span class="group">Demiprince</span> joined together into a pillar of fighting styles
               terrible to behold and they danced before the egg and its learning image.</p>
            
            
            <p>'Look, little Vehk, and find the face behind the splendor of my bladed carriage, for
               in
               it is delivered the unmixed conflict path, perfect in every way. What is its
               number?'</p>
            
            
            <p>It is said the number is the number of birds that can nest in an ancient tibrol tree,
               less three grams of honest work, but <span class="person">Vivec</span> in his later years found a better one and so
               gave this secret to his people.</p>
            
            
            <p>'For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but in my right hand
               is how
               it could have won against me. Love is under my will only.'</p>
            
            
            <p>The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.</p>
