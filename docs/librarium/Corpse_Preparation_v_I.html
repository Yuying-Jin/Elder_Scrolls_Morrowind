            <p>While the Arts of Necromancy are only illegal in the province of <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, few citizens
               of the <span class="group" id="Empire">Empire</span> have an enlightened view of our Art. Thus, the acquisition of corpses on
               which to experiment is often difficult.</p>
            
            
            <p>In <span class="location">Cyrodiil</span>, a few Necromancers who have served the <span class="group">Empire</span> are given the corpses of
               criminals and traitors to use legally. This provides those who have acquired such
               a post
               with a fresh supply of corpses, most of them young, strong, and intact.</p>
            
            
            <p>In <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, the outlawing of Necromancy would make its practice impossible were it not
               for the fortunate institution of slavery. While the Temple will investigate obvious
               signs of Necromancy such as hastily emptied graves or ash stolen from one of their
               ashpits, a careful and discrete Necromancer can thrive in <span class="location">Morrowind</span> by taking slaves at
               a modest rate. Most will assume the slave escaped or died in the <span class="location">Ashlands</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>Finding suitable corpses in <span class="location">Black Marsh</span> is nearly impossible due to their rapid decay.
               There are also diseases, <span class="group">Argonian</span> tribesmen, and other difficulties that must be dealt
               with. I know of only a few <span class="group">Sload</span> Necromancers who operate successfully in <span class="location">Black Marsh</span>,
               and even they stay near coast.</p>
            
            
            <p>While the forests of <span class="location">Elsweyr</span> pose some of the same problems as those of <span class="location">Black Marsh</span>, the
               deserts preserve corpses for hundreds of years in a way that requires very little
               preparation. <span class="group">Khajiit</span> of the desert tribes are often buried with only a small cairn of
               stones which are easy to find and uncover. The <span class="group">Khajiit</span> show remarkably enlightened
               indifference to graves being uncovered. It is said that in the port of Senchal, one
               may
               purchase anything one desires. This is true if you desire fresh corpses.</p>
            
            
            <p>While few Bosmer perform Arkay's rituals when burying the dead, the more primitive
               Bosmer
               still practice cannibalism upon their enemies, which reduces the number of available
               corpses. As would be expected from such a backwards people, they have an intolerance
               of
               Necromancy that goes beyond all reason. Many Necromancers who practice our Arts in
               Valenwood become "one with the trees" themselves.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="location">Summerset Isle</span> is even worse in some ways. Some <span class="group">Altmer</span> born into the most respected noble
               and scholarly families are actually allowed to study the dead in the open. Their
               research, however, seems to be centered on finding ways to extend their lives even
               further rather than the more practical uses of our Art. A Necromancer of any other
               race
               caught in <span class="location">Summerset Isle</span> can expect the worst possible punishments.</p>
            
            
            <p>In Hammerfell, where worship of Arkay is strongest, the dead are almost always subject
               to
               Arkay's Law. There are exceptions after large battles or in remote areas where death
               occurs far from meddlesome priests. Fortunately, the dangerous terrain and creatures
               in
               the deserts and mountains of Hammerfell makes the acquisition of corpses possible,
               though they are often in poor condition and require special care in preparation.</p>
            
            
            <p>The newly formed <span class="location">Orsinium</span> presents a unique opportunity. As you know, <span class="group">Orc</span> corpses are
               among the most sought after for the durability of their skin and the strength of their
               bones. If <span class="person" id="KingGortwog">King Gortwog</span> will listen to reason, we could offer the services of our Art in
               defense of his young nation in exchange for disposing of the <span class="group">Orc</span>ish dead. A mutually
               beneficial arrangement as I'm sure the <span class="group">Orc</span>s will agree. To this end, a delegation has
               been sent to <span class="location">Orsinium</span>, though we have not yet heard any word on the state of these
               negotiations.</p>
            
            
            <p>In my native <span class="location">High Rock</span>, traditions dating back to the witch kings and nomadic horsemen
               mandate cremation of the dead. This is practiced almost without exception in the north,
               through an Imperial burial in a tomb or city cemetery is more common in the south.
               There
               are still many corpses easily taken from the battlefields of the War of Betony and
               the
               lawless times that followed. There are even rumors that King Gothryd of Daggerfall
               may
               institute the Imperial practice of donating the corpses of criminals for Necromantic
               study as a deterrent to the bandits and pirates that still threaten the Iliac Bay.</p>
            
            
            <p>In Skyrim, the cold weather and isolated terrain allow a few Necromancers to operate
               freely. Alas, the availability of corpses is limited to <span class="group">Nords</span> who die from exposure or
               in battle. While the cold is preservative, the snow makes these corpses difficult
               to
               find. More research dedicated to the magical detection of corpses would be invaluable
               to
               the Necromancers of Skyrim.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <span class="group">Sload</span> are the most famous Necromancers, but little is known of their native <span class="location">Thras</span>. In
               Tamriel, <span class="group">Sload</span> only practice Necromancy on other races. It is uncertain whether this is
               true in <span class="location">Thras</span> as well. If so, it would explain the number of slaves that are purchased
               in <span class="location">Tear</span> by <span class="group">Sload</span> merchants and the rumors of <span class="group">Sload</span> airships carrying corpses from
               Senchal.</p>
            
            
            <p>These difficulties lead many Necromancers to create their own corpses. While I prefer
               to
               work with those who have died a natural death, a more expedient approach is sometimes
               necessary to further the study of the Art.</p>
            
            
            <p>While the Arts of Necromancy can be practiced on animals, such experiments rarely
               produce
               interesting results. The servant's ability to follow directions seems to be related
               to
               the subject's intelligence in life. While raising the corpse of a man, elf, or beastman
               can produce a useful servant, the corpses of animals produce mere guard dogs at best.
               Often a raised animal is unable to distinguish its master from the rest of the living
               and many amateur practitioners have been torn apart by the animal servants they created.
               Let such stories be a lesson to you.</p>
