            <p>EXCERPT: concerning the points of Temple doctrine challenged by the <span class="group" id="DissidentPriests">Dissident priests</span>:</p>
            
            
            <p>1. the divinity of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span></p>
            
            <p>Temple doctrine claims their apotheosis was miraculously achieved through questing,
               virtue, knowledge, testing, and battling with Evil; Temple doctrine claims their divine
               powers and immortality are ultimately conferred as a communal judgement by the <span class="group">Dunmer</span> ancestors [ including, among others, the Good <span class="group">Daedra</span>, the prophet <span class="person" id="Veloth">Veloth</span>, and Saint <span class="person">Nerevar</span> ]. <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> ask whether <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span>'s powers and the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> powers might ultimately derive from the same source -- <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>. Sources in the Apographa suggest that the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> relied on profanely enchanted tools to achieve godhead, and that those unholy devices
               were the ones originally created by the ungodly Dwemer sorceror <span class="person">Kagrenac</span> to create the False Construct Numidium.</p>
            
            
            <p>2. the purity of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span></p>
            
            <p>The <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> say that the Temple has always maintained a public face [represented by the Heirographa
               -- the "priestly writings"] and a hidden face [ represented by the Apographa -- the
               "hidden writings"]. The public account portrays the actions of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> in a heroic light, while the hidden writings reveal secrets, untruths, inconsistencies,
               conflicting accounts and varying interpretations which hint at darker and less heroic
               motives and actions of the Tribunes. In particular, conflicting accounts of the battle
               at <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> raise questions about the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>'s conduct, and about the source of their subsequent apotheosis. Also, there is good
               evidence that the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> have been concealing the true nature of the threat posed by <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span> at <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, misleading the people about the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>'s ability to protect <span class="location">Morrowind</span> from <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span>, and concealing a recent dramatic diminishing of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>'s magical powers.</p>
            
            
            <p>3. Temple accounts of the Battle of <span class="location">Red Mountain</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="group">Ashlander</span> tradition does not place the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> at <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, and holds that the <span class="group">Dwemer</span> destroyed themselves, rather than that <span class="person">Nerevar</span> destroyed them. <span class="group">Ashlander</span> tradition further holds that <span class="person">Nerevar</span> left <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span> guarding the profane secrets of <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> while <span class="person">Nerevar</span> went to confer with the Grand Council [i.e., the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>], that <span class="person">Nerevar</span> died at the conference [not of his wounds, according to the <span class="group">Ashlanders</span>, but from treachery], and that subsequently the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> confronted a defiant <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span> within <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, then drove <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span> beneath <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> when he would not yield to their will.</p>
            
            
            <p>4. veneration of the <span class="group">Daedra</span>, <span class="group">Saints</span>, and <span class="group">Ancestors</span></p>
            
            <p>While challenging the divinity of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>, the <span class="group">Dissidents</span> do not challenge the sainthood or heroism of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>. In fact, the <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> advocate restoring many of the elements of Fundamentalist Ancestor Worship as practiced
               by the <span class="group">Ashlanders</span> and by Saint <span class="person">Veloth</span>. Exactly how this would work is debated inconclusively within the <span class="group">Dissident priests</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>5. denial of the prophecies of the Incarnate, and persecution of the Nerevarines</p>
            
            <p>Though no consensus exists among the <span class="group">Dissidents</span> about whether the Nerevarine prophecies are genuine, all agree that the persecution of the Nerevarines is unjust and politically motivated. The <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> do not reject mysticism, revelation, or prophecy as part of the religious experience.
               The <span class="group">Dissidents</span> have not resolved the issue of true or false insights. They have studied the mysticism
               of the <span class="group">Ashlander</span> Ancestor Cults, in particular the rites of the <span class="group">Ashlander</span> seers and wise women, and the prophecies of the Incarnate. Many among the <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> have come to believe that the Nerevarine prophecies are genuine, and have made a systematic study of prophecies recorded in
               Temple archives.</p>
            
            
            <p>6. Authority of the <span class="person">Archcanon</span> and the <span class="group">Ordinators</span></p>
            
            <p>The <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> reject the authority of the <span class="person">Archcanon</span> and the <span class="group">Ordinators</span>. The temple hierarchy has been corrupted by self-interest and politics, and no longer
               acts in the best interests of the Temple or its worshippers. The <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> believe the <span class="person">Archcanon</span> and <span class="group">Ordinators</span> speak for themselves, not for the <span class="group">Tribunal</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>7. the Inquisition and the use of terror and torture by the <span class="group">Ordinators</span></p>
            
            <p>Within the Temple hierarchy it is an open secret that the <span class="group">Ordinators</span> rely on abduction, terror, torture, and secret imprisonment to discourage heresy
               and dissent. The <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> feel the <span class="group">Ordinators</span> are either out of control, or tools used to maintain a corrupt priesthood in power.</p>
            
            
            <p>8. fundamentals of Temple doctrine - Charity for the Poor, Education for the Ignorant,
               Protection for the Weak</p>
            
            <p>Though the <span class="group">Dissident priests</span> acknowledge that most rank-and-file priests honor the best traditions of the Temple,
               they believe that many priests in higher ranks are interested more in love of authority
               and luxury than in the welfare of the poor, weak, and ignorant.</p>
