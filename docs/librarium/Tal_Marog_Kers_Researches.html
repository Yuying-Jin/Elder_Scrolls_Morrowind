            <p>Chimere, Master Sorcerer, Summoner, and <span class="group" id="Direnni">Direnni</span> retainer.</p>
            
            <p><span class="person" id="ChimereGraegyn">Chimere Graegyn</span> was a retainer of the ambitious <span class="group">Direnni</span> clan. The <span class="group">Direnni</span> derived the bulk of their power from their traffickings with <span class="group">Daedra</span>, a very profitable but risky path to success. Chimere was perhaps the cleverest and
               most ambitious of the <span class="group">Direnni</span> summoners. He dared to scheme against <span class="person">Lord Dagonn</span>, and won. When his trick succeeded, Dagon was cast into <span class="location">Oblivion</span>. However, in the instant of his betrayal, Dagon struck out against the mortal who
               tricked him. Chimere's pact assured that he would live forever in his home town among
               the happy voices of his friends and countrymen. Twisting the literal words of Chimere's
               pact, Dagon scooped up tiny <span class="location">Caecilly Island</span> (a small island off the coast of Northmoor) and hurled in into the void. All Chimere's
               friends and countrymen were instantly killed, though the sounds of their voices remained
               to torment Chimere's memory. Chimere was condemned to live forever, to grow progressively
               old and crippled with arthritis, and to contemplate the tragic consequences of his
               defiance of fate and fortune in cheating a <span class="group">Daedra</span> Lord.</p>
            
            <p><span class="item" id="armorofthesaviourshide:">Armor of the Saviour's Hide:</span></p>
            
            <p>Created by the <span class="group">Daedra</span> Lord <span class="person">Malacath</span>, this armor has the marvelous property of turning the blow of an oathbreaker. Chimere
               tricked Dagon into swearing an oath against the Powers which he had no intention of
               keeping. The Hide of the Savior turned Dagon's titanic fury long enough for Chimere
               to deliver his own attack -- an incantation invoked upon Dagon's "Protonymic" (i.e.,
               Incantory [sic] True Name). Unfortunately, like many of <span class="person">Malacath</span>'s gifts, the armor is a mixed blessing. It also makes its wearer exceptionally vulnerable
               to magical attacks, so one should only wear it for particular occasions.</p>
            
            <p>Dagon's Protonymic:</p>
            
            <p>Chimere used Dagon's Protonymic in an incantation to invoke a sorcery that would gradually
               drain all of Dagon's power into the void. Chimere miscalculated, however, not realizing
               that Dagon's resistance could slow the draining of his power, even if it could not
               stop it. As a result, Dagon had the time to curse Chimere with a literal fulfillment
               of the terms of his bargain with Chimere. Rather than let his power drain into the
               void, Dagon cast it all into his curse. As a result, <span class="location">Caecilly Island</span> was cast into the void, all its citizens were horribly slain, and Chimere was condemned
               to live forever among the ruins of his greatest ambition.</p>
            
            <p>Rituals of the Hunt:</p>
            
            <p>The Chapel of the Innocent Quarry: Chimere believes that Dagon had <span class="location">Caecilly Island</span> established as the site of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry to personally mock and
               torment Chimere. The green crystal structure was created by enchantments, and is the
               only building on the island erected since it was ripped from <span class="location">Tamriel</span> and loosed in the void.</p>
            
            <p>The Spear:</p>
            
            <p>Supposedly the <span class="item">Spear of Bitter Mercy</span> used in the Wild Hunts could not be handled by any mortal or immortal save the ones
               sanctified to the Hunt and bound by its strictures. However, Chimere has determined
               that though the Spear's power is great, it is not unlimited, and that certain enchanted
               items -- for instance, the Armor of the Savior's Hide, forged by <span class="person">Malacath</span> -- are sufficient to protect a mortal or immortal bearer from its maleficent energies</p>
