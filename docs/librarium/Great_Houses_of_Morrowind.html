            <h1>Great Houses of Morrowind</h1>
            <h3>Anonymous</h3>
            <h4>Acquisitions</h4>
            <ul id="acq"></ul>
            
            <p>In modern times <span class="location" id="Morrowind">Morrowind</span> is ruled
               by five Great Houses: House <span class="group" id="Hlaalu">Hlaalu</span>, House <span class="group">Redoran</span>, House <span class="group">Telvanni</span>, House
               <span class="group">Indoril</span>, and House <span class="group">Dres</span>. Only
               three of these Houses have interests in <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>. The three Great Houses on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> identify themselves by their traditional
               colors: red for <span class="group">Redoran</span>, yellow for <span class="group">Hlaalu</span>, and brown for <span class="group">Telvanni</span>. Thus, members
               of House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> may be referred to collectively as
               Yellows.</p>
            
            
            <p>The Great Houses traditions derive from ancient <span class="group">Dunmer</span> clan
               and tribes, but now function as political parties. <span class="group">Dunmer</span>
               Great House membership is largely a matter of birth and marriage, but <span class="group">Imperial</span> colonists may also become retainers of a Great
               House, or may be adopted into a Great House. Initially an outlander may gain status
               in a
               house as an oath-bonded hireling, pledging exclusive loyalty to a single house and
               forsaking ambitions with all other houses. Later, after faithful service and advancement
               in lower ranks, an outlander may seek adoption into a Great House. Adoption and
               advancement to higher ranks in a Great House requires that a Great House councilor
               stand
               as sponsor for the candidate's character and loyalty. Finding a councilor to sponsor
               an
               outlander often involves performing a great service for the prospective sponsor.</p>
            
            
            <p>House <span class="group">Redoran</span> is one of the three <span class="group">Dunmer</span> Great Houses with holdings on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>. The <span class="group">Redoran</span>
               prize the virtues of duty, gravity, and piety. Duty is to one's own honor, and to
               one's
               family and clan. Gravity is the essential seriousness of life. Life is hard, and events
               must be judged, endured, and reflected upon with due care and earnestness. Piety is
               respect for the gods, and the virtues they represent. A light, careless life is not
               worth living. <span class="group">Redoran</span> settlements are designed in the
               <span class="group">Dunmer</span> village style, built of local materials, with
               organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells
               of
               giant native insects. <span class="group">Redoran</span> villages are typically
               centered on Temple compounds and their courtyards, with huts and tradehouses gathered
               around a central plaza, as in the West Gash village of <span class="location">Gnisis</span>. Ald'ruhn, the <span class="group">Redoran</span> district seat, is exceptional, with its distinctive feature being
               the colossal prehistoric bug shell that has been adapted as the house's council
               house.</p>
            
            
            <p>As a result of its close relationship with the <span class="group">Imperial</span>
               administration, House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> has emerged as politically and
               economically dominant among the Great Houses of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> and <span class="location">Morrowind</span>. <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> welcomes <span class="group">Imperial</span> culture and law, <span class="group">Imperial</span> Legions and bureaucracy, and <span class="group">Imperial</span> freedom of trade and religion. <span class="group">Hlaalu</span>
               still honors the old <span class="group">Dunmer</span> ways—the ancestors, the Temple,
               and the noble houses—but has readily adapted to the rapid pace of change and progress
               in
               the <span class="group">Imperial</span> provinces. Unlike the other Great Houses,
               which are largely hostile to non-<span class="group">Dunmer</span>, House <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> aspires to live in peace and harmony with the other
               races, and to share in the growth and prosperity of the Empire. <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> public buildings—tradehouses and craft guilds, manors and council
               halls—are designed as simple multi-storied buildings roughly rectangular in plan,
               featuring arched entranceways and modest decorated exteriors. More modest one-story
               private dwellings follow the same plan, except with less decoration. <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> plantation estates resemble Temple compounds, with walled precincts
               enclosing outbuildings for craftsmen and servants, dominated by a grand manor residence
               in place of a Temple shrine.</p>
            
            
            <p>The wizard-lords of House <span class="group">Telvanni</span> have traditionally
               isolated themselves, pursuing wisdom and mastery in solitude. But certain ambitious
               wizards-lords, their retainers, and clients have entered whole-heartedly into the
               competition to control and exploit <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>'s land and resources, building towers and bases all along
               the eastern coast. According to <span class="group">Telvanni</span> principles, the
               powerful define the standards of virtue, and the <span class="group">Telvanni</span>
               are unwilling to allow the ambitious <span class="group">Hlaalu</span> to dominate
               <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>'s untapped
               resources by default. <span class="group">Telvanni</span> architecture is dominated
               by the wizards' tower, a fantastic organic form grown and sculpted from stems, caps,
               and
               root-like holdfasts of the giant native mushrooms. <span class="group">Telvanni</span> villages are comprised of smaller mushroom pods hollowed out for
               craftsmen and commoners. Open-air markets often include the giant cages displaying
               the
               wares of the slave masters.</p>
            
            
            <p>House <span class="group">Indoril</span> and House <span class="group">Dres</span> are
               the two Great Houses without holdings or interest in <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>. <span class="location">Indoril</span> District occupies the heartland of <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, comprising the lands south of the Inner Sea
               and the eastern coast. The city of <span class="location">Almalexia</span> is located in <span class="location">Indoril</span> District, and the <span class="group">Indoril</span> are
               orthodox and conservative supporters of the Temple and Temple authority. House <span class="group">Indoril</span> is openly hostile to <span class="group">Imperial</span> culture and religion, and preserves many traditional <span class="group">Dunmer</span> customs and practices in defiance of <span class="group">Imperial</span> law. <span class="group">Dres</span> District is in
               the south of <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, bordering
               the swamps and marshes of Black Marsh. House <span class="group">Dres</span> is an
               agrarian agricultural society, and its large saltrice plantations rely completely
               on
               slave labor for their economic viability. Always firm Temple supporters, House <span class="group">Dres</span> is hostile to <span class="group">Imperial</span> law and
               culture, and in particular opposed to any attempts to limit the institution of
               slavery.</p>
