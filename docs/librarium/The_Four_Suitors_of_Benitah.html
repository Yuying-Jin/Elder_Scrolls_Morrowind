            <p>Up until he was ten years old, <span class="person" id="Oin">Oin</span> Parnafacasis was in an elite group of the very best families of <span class="location">Gnisis</span>. They went to the very best tailors, shared the same tutors, played in the same exclusive
               company. When his mother died, and his father discovered that the money they had been
               living on was based on a thief's salary, he suddenly found himself on a very different
               kind of society, one that he had been ill-equipped to deal with. They were poor.</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Oin</span> eventually learned to make a living at the only skill he seemed to be well-suited
               for: gardening. In time, he had grown an impressive garden of <span class="item" id="willow anther">willow anther</span>, <span class="item">gold kanet</span>, <span class="item">chokeweed</span>, <span class="item">white bloatroot</span>, and <span class="item">trama shrubs</span>. He had also grown himself into a remarkably uninteresting man -- aside from his
               gardening, he had little to say for himself. Unlearned, uncharismatic, unathletic,
               uncoordinated. And yet he yearned. Specifically, he yearned for a girl he had known
               before all his trouble, a sweet thing with curly locks and a joyous laugh named Benitah
               Gorgoth. Once when at play he had pushed a bully away who was trying to hurt her,
               and the look of appreciation she gave him was enough to make all his days since then
               worth their while.</p>
            
            <p>As he tended his garden one springtide, not very many years ago, he heard some people
               talking through the thick tall <span class="item">trama shrubs</span> about the marriage of <span class="person">Sedura Indoril Pavflek Mamoona</span>, one of the wealthiest and most respected nobles in <span class="location">Gnisis</span>, and Serjo <span class="person">Benitah</span> Gorgoth. His heart fell. She had found another, a mere nine years since she had given
               him that look while at play.</p>
            
            <p>As spring turned into summer and summer into fall, <span class="person">Oin</span> began to sell his herbs, including some to Kena <span class="person">Kena Yakin Bael</span>, a prominent healer in town. He had been a tutor to both <span class="person">Benitah</span> and <span class="person">Oin</span>, and told the young man that the lady's husband was not very well. <span class="person">Oin</span> held back his happiness and continued on his errands.</p>
            
            <p>Not long afterwards, <span class="person">Sedura Indoril Pavflek Mamoona</span> fell ill and died, despite all the skills of the great healers, including <span class="person">Kena Yakin Bael</span>. When <span class="person">Oin</span> came to deliver the herbs that day, he said, "If you are still in communication with
               <span class="person">Benitah</span>, please give her my sympathies."</p>
            
            <p>"'Nchow," said Yakin. "If I could get a word in with all her counselors. They are
               trying to find her a new husband, and she has made it clear that she will only marry
               the strongest man in <span class="location">Morrowind</span>."</p>
            
            <p>"Who is that?" asked <span class="person">Oin</span>.</p>
            
            <p>"Horath the Strong," replied Yakin. "It is said that he can lift a wagon with but
               his forefinger and thumb."</p>
            
            <p>"You can teach me a spell that will fortify my own strength," said <span class="person">Oin</span>. "I beg you to teach it to me now."</p>
            
            <p>"Very well," replied Yakin. "But in return, I want your next season's worth of trama
               root, all to myself."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Oin</span> agreed, and Yakin taught him the spell to fortify his strength. It took him some
               time to master it, visualizing magicka streaming through his body, pumping through
               the very fibers of his muscles for a time, giving him strength far beyond the puny
               power nature had intended. When <span class="person">Oin</span> met Horath on the street of <span class="location">Gnisis</span>, he cast the spell and challenged him to a duel of strength.</p>
            
            <p>"I am Kena Warfel Tomasin, and I can prove that <span class="location">Akatosh</span>, <span class="location">Nirn</span>, and <span class="location">Oblivion</span> are one," said Warfel, writing out the mathematical formula that showed it was so.</p>
            
            <p>"I am Kena Zombel Mokafa, and I can prove that you do not exist," said <span class="person">Oin</span>. He wrote out the mathematical formula, which proved correct, and Kena Warfel Tomasin
               vaporized on the spot.</p>
            
            <p>The word went out quickly throughout <span class="location">Morrowind</span>: the most intelligent man alive was in the province. <span class="person">Oin</span> went to visit his friend, <span class="person">Kena Yakin Bael</span>.</p>
            
            <p>"Her lady <span class="person">Benitah</span> has heard of the intelligence of Kena Zombel Mokafa, and has said that she was mistaken.
               She was not looking for a man of intelligence to marry, but a man of endurance, a
               rock. The greatest in all Morrowind."</p>
            
            <p>"Who is that?" asked <span class="person">Oin</span>.</p>
            
            <p>"I would say, <span class="person">Master Combova</span>," said Yakin. "They say he can stand in blue flames for twenty minutes."</p>
            
            <p>"You can teach me a spell that will fortify my own endurance," said <span class="person">Oin</span>. "I beg you to teach it to me now."</p>
            
            <p>"Very well," replied Yakin. "But in return, I want your next season's worth of <span class="item">chokeweed</span>, all to myself."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Oin</span> agreed, and for the next several weeks, he learned the spell to make his endurance
               like that of the oldest stone. He learned how to shrug off the effects of frost, poison,
               fire, and charges of lightning, pulling the pain into a reservoir of magicka and expelling
               it. The lesson learned, he came across <span class="person">Master Combova</span> at the <span class="group" id="Madach_Tradehouse">Madach Tradehouse</span>&gt;.</p>
            
            <p>"My name is <span class="person">Master Combova</span>," said the fellow, nudging the witch next to him. "Kena Leles, cast a ball of blue
               flame for me." And he sat in the inferno of flame for twenty minutes before he left.</p>
            
            <p>"<span class="person">Master Combova</span>, my name is <span class="person">Master Vomph</span>," said <span class="person">Oin</span>. "Kena Leles, cast a ball of blue flames for me." <span class="person">Oin</span> sat in the inferno of blue fire for very nearly an hour before he left.</p>
            
            <p>The word went out quickly throughout <span class="location">Morrowind</span>: the toughest man alive was in the province. <span class="person">Oin</span> went to visit his friend, <span class="person">Kena Yakin Bael</span>.</p>
            
            <p>"Her lady <span class="person">Benitah</span> has heard of the endurance of <span class="person">Master Vomph</span>," he said, not entirely approving of <span class="person">Oin</span>'s latest sobriquet, "And has said that she was mistaken. She was not looking for
               a man of endurance to marry, but a man of agility, a nimble acrobat. The greatest
               in all <span class="location">Morrowind</span>."</p>
            
            <p>"Who is that?" asked <span class="person">Oin</span>.</p>
            
            <p>"I would say, Funcrazot <span class="person">Priif</span>," said Yakin. "They say he is the greatest shield-blocker and pickpocket in <span class="location">Morrowind</span>."</p>
            
            <p>"You can teach me a spell that will fortify my own agility," said <span class="person">Oin</span>. "I beg you to teach it to me now."</p>
            
            <p>"Very well," replied Yakin. "But in return, I want your next season's worth of <span class="item">gold kanet</span>, all to myself."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Oin</span> agreed, and Yakin taught him the spell that would fire his impulses with magicka.
               Over several weeks, he learned how to supplant his own natural energy with the spell's,
               how to view the world at the slower pace a man with advanced agility sees. In time,
               <span class="person">Oin</span> came upon Funcrazot in a field outside the city, d<span class="person">Oin</span>g his regular exercises. <span class="person">Oin</span> cast his spell and approached the acrobat.</p>
            
            <p>"Ah, behold the power of the amazing Funcrazot <span class="person">Priif</span>," said the afore-mentioned, and prompted his sparring partner to attack him with
               his sword. He blocked the blows effortlessly with a shield for ten minutes, and then
               revealed afterwards that he had picketpocketed the young man's purse.</p>
            
            <p>"Very impressive, Ser <span class="person">Priif</span>. Now, behold the power of the remarkable Gazouf Mough," said <span class="person">Oin</span>, and prompted <span class="person">Priif</span>'s sparring partner to attack him with his sword. After twenty minutes of blocking
               the man's blows with his shield, he revealed that he had pickpocketed Funcrazot <span class="person">Priif</span>'s purse.</p>
            
            <p>The word went out quickly throughout <span class="location">Morrowind</span>: the most agile man alive was in the province. <span class="person">Oin</span> went to visit his friend, <span class="person">Kena Yakin Bael</span>. The door was closed this time and he heard voices within.</p>
            
            <p>"Have you heard about the remarkable Gazouf Mough?" <span class="person">Kena Yakin Bael</span> was asking. "He sounds like a very promising suitor."</p>
            
            <p>"The truth is, kena, that I have no more interest in him that I had in <span class="person">Nimlom the Mighty</span>, Kena Zombel Mokafa, or <span class="person">Master Vomph</span>," replied a feminine voice that seemed familiar to <span class="person">Oin</span>. "I will have to invent a new test for suitors, while I search for my true love."</p>
            
            <p>"You don't wish to marry the strongest, most intelligent, toughest, most agile suitors?"
               asked the old Healer.</p>
            
            <p>"No, not at all," said the woman. "I had to make some kind of test to rebuff the advances
               of so many men interested in my money and the money of my late husband. The truth
               is that I've never forgotten the young boy who was so kind to me when I was a little
               girl, and so brave fighting off the bullies. His name was <span class="person">Oin</span> Parnafacasis."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Oin</span> burst into the room and was reunited with <span class="person">Benitah</span>. They were married at once. A week later, he returned to <span class="person">Kena Yakin Bael</span> and learned how to fortify his personality in exchange for next season's worth of
               <span class="item">willow anther</span>. Then they lived happily ever after.</p>
