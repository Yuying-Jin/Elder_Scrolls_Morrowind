            <p>"Outnumbered and isolated, I yielded to my foe. The creature dressed like a gentleman,
               and I hoped for honorable treatment. Instead, I found myself a feast for a
               blood-drinking monster.</p>
            
            
            <p>"Shamed by my corruption, and despairing of my own welfare, I passively acquiesced
               in my
               gradual integration into the affairs of <span class="group" id="ClanAundae">Clan Aundae</span>. I made no human my prey, only
               beasts, and kept myself apart from the other clankin; nonetheless, I abandoned hope
               and
               lived like a beast.</p>
            
            
            <p> "Drawn by intimations of my former life, I visited my former post at <span class="location">Bal Ur</span>, hoping
               perhaps to atone in some for my crimes by preying upon its monsters, or perishing
               under
               their attacks. It is there that, by chance, I made petition to the Lord of Troubles,
               <span class="person" id="MolagBal">Molag Bal</span>, at an altar deep in the caverns beneath the pilgrim's shrine. I was
               surprised, and thrilled, and terrified, when <span class="person">Molag Bal</span>, or some aspect or agent of that
               Daedra Lord, offered me a chance to cure myself of vampirism, in return for a favor.
               However, with no hope for my soul or spirit unless I might be cured, I undertook his
               quest.</p>
            
            
            <p>[Rithari sought and obtained a cursed soul gem of mysterious nature from a deep cavern
               on
               the northern slopes of <span class="location">Dagoth Ur</span>, delivering it to <span class="person">Molag Bal's</span> shrine in <span class="location">Bal Ur</span>.]</p>
            
            
            <p>"I placed the gem within the basin before the altar, and instantly experienced a blinding
               of pain and terror that I cannot express in words, except that it seemed afterward
               that
               I had been asleep and dreaming that I was being sliced by thousands of tiny knives
               from
               my bowels inside out. I awoke before the altar, and gazed in the reflection of my
               own
               sword blade at my own face - no longer a blood-seeking beast of teeth and empty
               eyes."</p>
