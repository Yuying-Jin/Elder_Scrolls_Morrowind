            <p>"The problem with thieves today," said <span class="person" id="Lledos">Lledos</span>, "Is the lack of technique. I know there's no honor among thieves, and there never
               was, but there used to be some pride, some skill, some basic creativity. It really
               makes those of us with a sense of history despair."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Imalyn</span> sneered, slamming down his flagon of greef violently on the rough-hewn table. "B'vek,
               what do you want us to say? You asks us 'What do you do when you see a guard?' and
               I says, 'Stab the fetcher in the back.' What d'you prefer? We challenge 'em to a game
               of chits?"</p>
            
            <p>"So much ambition, so little education," said <span class="person">Lledos</span> with a sigh. "My dear friends, we aren't mugging some <span class="group" id="Nord">Nord</span> tourist fresh off the ferry. The <span class="location">Cobblers Guildhall </span>may not sound intimidating but tonight, when the dues collection is housed there before
               being sent to the bank, the security's going to be tighter than a <span class="group">kwama</span>'s ass. You can't just stab at every back you encounter and expect to make it into
               the vaults."</p>
            
            <p>"Why don't you explain specifically what you'd like us to do?" asked <span class="person">Galsiah</span> calmly, trying to keep the tone of the group down. Most locals at the <span class="location">Plot and Plaster</span> cornerclub in <span class="location">Tel Aruhn</span> knew enough not to listen in, but she knew better than to take any chances.</p>
            
            <p>"The common thief," said <span class="person">Lledos</span>, pouring himself more greef, warming to his subject. "Sticks his dagger in his opponent's
               back. This may slay the target, but more often gives him time to scream and drenches
               the attacker with blood. Not good. Now a good throat-slashing, properly executed,
               can both slay and silence a guard and leave the thief relatively bloodfree. And after
               all, after the robbery, we don't want people seeing a bunch of blood-soaked butchers
               running through the streets. Even in <span class="location">Tel Aruhn</span>, that's likely to warrant suspicion.</p>
            
            <p>"If you can catch your victim lying down asleep or resting, you are in an excellent
               position. You place one hand over the mouth with your thumb under the chin, then you
               use your other hand to slit the throat, and quickly turn the head to one side so the
               body bleeds out away from you. There is a risk here of becoming blood stained if you
               don't move the head quickly enough. If you're unsure, strangle the victim first to
               avoid the blood that tends to spurt out in three foot jets when someone is stabbed
               while alive.</p>
            
            <p>"A very good friend of mine, a thief in <span class="location">Gnisis</span> whose name I won't mention, swears by the strangle-and-slash technique. Simply put,
               you grab your victim's throat from behind and while throttling him, you batter his
               face against the opposite wall. When the victim is thus rendered unconscious, you
               slash his throat while still holding him from behind, and the risk of staining one's
               clothes with blood is practically nonexistant.</p>
            
            <p>"The classic technique, which requires less grappling than my friend's variation,
               is to place one hand over the victim's mouth, and then saw through the throat in three
               or four stroke rather like playing a violin. It requires little effort, and while
               there's quite a bit of blood, it all jets forward away from you.</p>
            
            <p>There's no reason when one knows one is going to be slitting some throats not to take
               some precautions and bring some extra equipment. The best neck-hackers I know generally
               carry a bit of wadded cloth on the aft-side of their knives to keep blood from getting
               on their cuffs. It's impractical for this sort of assignment, but when you're only
               anticipating one or two victims, nothing beats throwing a sack over the targets [sic]
               head, drawing the string tight, and then supplying the killing blow or blows."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Imalyn</span> laughed loudly, "Can I see a demonstration sometime?"</p>
            
            <p>"Very soon," said <span class="person">Lledos</span>. "If <span class="person">Galsiah</span> has done her job."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Galsiah</span> brought out the map of the guildhouse, freshly stolen, and they began to detail out
               the strategy.</p>
            
            <p>The last several hours had been a whirlwind to all. In less than a day, the three
               had met, formulated a plan, bought or stolen the necessary ingredients, and were about
               to execute it. Not one of the three were sure whether confidence or stupidity were
               driving the other two, but the fates were aligned. The guildhouse was going to be
               robbed.</p>
            
            <p>When the sun set, <span class="person">Lledos</span>, <span class="person">Galsiah</span>, and <span class="person">Imalyn</span> approached the Cobblers Guildhouse on the east end of town. <span class="person">Galsiah</span> used her cachous of <span class="item" id="stoneflower">stoneflower</span> to mask their scent from the guard wolves as the three passed over the parapets.
               She also acted as lead scout, and <span class="person">Lledos</span> was impressed. For someone of relative inexperience, she knew her way through shadows.</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Lledos</span>'s expertise was demonstrated a dozen times, and the guards were of such a diverse
               variety, he was able to demonstrate all the means of silent assassination he had developed
               over the years.</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Imalyn</span> opened the vault in his unique and systematic method. As the tumblers fell beneath
               his fingers, he softly sang an old dirty tavern song about the Ninety-Nine Loves of
               <span class="person">Boethiah</span>. He said it helped him focus and organize difficult combinations. Within seconds,
               the vault was open and the gold was in hand.</p>
            
            <p>They left the guildhouse an hour after they entered. No alarm had been raised, the
               gold was gone, and corpses lay pooling blood on the stone floors within.</p>
            
            <p>"Well done, my friends, well done. You learned well." <span class="person">Lledos</span> said as he poured the gold pieces into the specially designed compartments in his
               tunic's sleeves, where they held fast with no jingling or unusual bulges. "We'll meet
               back at the <span class="location">Plot and Plaster</span> tomorrow morning and split up the bounty."</p>
            
            <p>The group parted ways. The only person who knew the most covert route through the
               city's sewer system, <span class="person">Lledos</span>, slipped in through a duct and vanished below. <span class="person">Galsiah</span> threw on her shawl, muddied her face to resemble an old f'lah fortune-teller, and
               headed north. <span class="person">Imalyn</span> headed east into the park, trusting his unnatural senses to keep him away from the
               citywatch.</p>
            
            <p>Now I teach them the greatest lesson of all, thought <span class="person">Lledos</span> as he sloshed through the labyrinthine tunnels of sludge. His guar was waiting where
               he left it at the city gates, making a laconic lunch of the chokeweed shrub to which
               it had been leashed.</p>
            
            <p>On the road to Vivec, he thought of <span class="person">Galsiah</span> and <span class="person">Imalyn</span>. Perhaps they had been caught and brought in for questioning already. It was a pity
               he couldn't see them undergoing interrogation. Who would break under pressure first?
               <span class="person">Imalyn</span> was certainly the tougher of the two, but <span class="person">Galsiah</span> doubtless had hidden reserves. It was merely intellectual curiousity they thought
               his name was <span class="person">Lledos</span> and he was meeting them at the <span class="location">Plot and Plaster</span>. The authorities wouldn't therefore be looking for a Dunmer named <span class="person">Sathis</span> celebrating his wealth miles and miles away in Vivec.</p>
            
            <p>As he prodded his mount forward and the sun began rising, <span class="person">Sathis</span> pictured <span class="person">Galsiah</span> and <span class="person">Imalyn</span> not undergoing interrogation, but sleeping the good deep sleep of the wicked, dreaming
               of how they would spend their share of the gold. Both would wake up early and rush
               to the <span class="location">Plot and Plaster</span>. He could see them now, <span class="person">Imalyn</span> laughing and carrying on, <span class="person">Galsiah</span> hushing him to avoid bringing undue attention. They would take a couple flagons of
               greef, perhaps order a meal -- a big one -- and wait. Hours would pass, and so would
               their moods. The chain of reactions that every betrayed person exhibits: nervousness,
               doubt, bewilderment, anger.</p>
            
            <p>The sun was fully risen when <span class="person">Sathis</span> reached the stables of his house on the outskirts of Vivec. He reigned in his guar
               and filled its feed. The rest of the stalls were empty. It wouldn't be until that
               afternoon when his servants returned from the feast of St <span class="person">Rilms</span> in <span class="location">Gnisis</span>. They were good people, and he treated them well, but from past experience he knew
               that servants talked. If they began to connect his absences with thefts in other towns,
               it was only a matter of time before they would go to the authorities or blackmail
               him. After all, they were human. It was best in the long run to give them a week off
               with pay whenever he was out of town on business.</p>
            
            <p>He slipped the gold into the vault in his study, and went upstairs. The schedule had
               been tight, but <span class="person">Sathis</span> had given himself a few hours to rest before his household returned. His own bed
               was wonderfully soft and warm compared to the dreadful mattress he had to use at the
               canton in <span class="location">Tel Aruhn</span>.</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Sathis</span> woke up some time later from a nightmare. For a second after he opened his eyes,
               he thought he could still hear <span class="person">Imalyn</span>'s voice nearby, singing The Ninety-Nine Loves of <span class="person">Boethiah</span>. He lay still in his bed, waiting, but there was no sound except the usual creaks
               and groans of his old house. Afternoon sunlight came through his bedroom window in
               ribbons, catching dust. He closed his eyes.</p>
            
            <p>The song returned, and <span class="person">Sathis</span> heard the vault door in his study swing open. The smell of <span class="item">stoneflower</span> filled his nose and he opened his eyes. Only a little of the afternoon sunlight could
               pierce the inside of the burlap sack.</p>
            
            <p>A strong, feminine hand clamped over the mouth and a thumb jabbed under his chin.
               Just as his throat opened and his head was shoved to the side, he heard <span class="person">Galsiah</span> in her typical calm voice, "Thank you for the lesson, <span class="person">Sathis</span>."</p>
