            <p>[from the correspondence of <span class="person" id="CuseiusPlecia">Cuseius Plecia</span>, <span class="group" id="Imperials">Imperial</span> trader, writing from the <span class="location">Vos</span> Tradehouse in <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> District, Province of <span class="location">Morrowind</span>]</p>
            
            
            <p>"...I have noted that <span class="group">Heartlanders</span> like myself, and assimilated <span class="group">Imperial</span> Citizens of other races, tend to impersonal and formal relationships with their gods
               and spirits. For us, cults are first and foremost social and economic organizations.
               We typically think of the Eight Divines in the most abstract terms -- as powerful
               but indifferent spirits to be propitiated, and do not think of their relationships
               as personal. Notable exceptions include minor charismatic sub-cults of <span class="person">Akatosh</span> and <span class="person">Dibella</span>. The <span class="group">Imperial Cult</span> of <span class="person">Tiber Septim</span> also has a significant charismatic sub-cult.</p>
            
            
            <p>With the exception of the <span class="group">Alessian Order</span>, which <span class="group">Heartlanders</span> regard as a dark age, religious cults have played only minor parts in <span class="group">Heartlanders</span> and <span class="group">Imperial</span> history. The <span class="group">Septim emperors</span> have made it a policy to limit the influence of cult authorities in aristocratic,
               military, and bureaucratic affairs. Cult worship is regarded as a private and practical
               matter, and public pronouncements by religious figures are not welcomed.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="group">Nordic</span> hero-cults provide a strong counter-current to the dominant secularism of the <span class="group">Empire</span>. The <span class="group">Imperial Cult</span> of <span class="person">Tiber Septim</span> is just such a hero-cult, and among the military, provincial colonists, and recently
               assimilated foreigners, the cult is particularly strong and personal.</p>
            
            
            <p>The <span class="group">Tribunal Temple</span> in <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, and its predecessor, house ancestor cults, are, by contrast with <span class="group">Imperial cults</span>, extremely intimate and personal. In ancestor cults, the worshipper has a direct
               relationship with a blood family ancestor spirit, and the <span class="group">Temple cultist's</span> relationship with the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> is a relationship with a living, breathing god who walks the earth, speaks in person
               with priests and cultists, and whose daily actions are prescribed models for the daily
               actions of their followers.</p>
            
            
            <p>The differences in religious temperament between <span class="group">Heartlanders</span> and <span class="location">Morrowind</span> <span class="group">Dunmer</span> accounts in large part for consistent political and social misunderstanding between
               the two cultures. <span class="group">Heartlanders</span> do not consider cult affairs as serious matters, where the <span class="group">Dunmer</span> consider cult affairs, and in particular, ancestral spirit veneration, to be very
               serious matters indeed.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="group">Heartlanders</span> are casual and tolerant in religious matters; <span class="group">Dunmer</span> are passionate and extremely intolerant. <span class="group">Heartlanders</span> do not speak with their gods, and do not think of their actions as under constant
               review and judgement by their gods; the <span class="group">Dunmer</span> feel that all they think and do is under the ever-watchful eye of the <span class="group">Tribunal</span> and family ancestor spirits...."</p>
